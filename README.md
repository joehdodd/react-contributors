# React Repository Contributors

### Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

Although GitHub's API mentions a token, I didn't have issues accessing the endpoints used in this application. 

### Styling

Decided to use `styled-components` because I think they make the most sense right now for my workflow. And styling is intentional. Inconsolata is the font I used to drive home the computer/programming look. I didn't use `text-decoration: none;` because that's the look I was going for.
